/**
 * Implement Fibonacci Series with Iterators
 *
 * Example: The Fibonacci Series is:
 * 0
 * 1
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 5
 * 8
 *
 * Guidelines:
 * 1.The expected output should be achieved using Iterators only.
 * 2.Reference:https://medium.com/@akshayshekokar/fibonacci-series-with-iterators-90a8b3dd0d92
 * 3.For Loops, Maps should not have been used.
 * 4.3rd party libraries should not have been used.
 *
 * Outcome:
 * 1.Understanding how Iterators work.
 * 2.Understanding ‘under the hood’ implementation of Iterators.
